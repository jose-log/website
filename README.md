# Personal Website

This is my personal website/blog. Here I post my projects, articles, and curriculum vitae. This is part of the process of learning web technologies.

## [**joselog.co**][joselog]

This site is obviously hosted using [Github Pages][pages] and makes use of [Jekyll][jekyll], the Static Site Generator supported by GitHub. The template I'm using is called [Lagrange][lagrange], by [Paul Le][paul].

[joselog]:  https://joselog.co
[pages]:    https://pages.github.com/
[jekyll]:   https://jekyllrb.com/
[lagrange]: https://github.com/LeNPaul/Lagrange
[paul]:     https://lenpaul.com

Over time, I expect to tweak it and adapt it to my taste.
